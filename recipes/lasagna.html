        <h2 class="des">Description</h2>
        <p class="content">This is a traditional dish in my family. 
            Anyone can make it really. 
            It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients 
            layered over the top of one another <br> in a 
            lasagna- like fashion (hence the name) but has 
            little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have 
            no fear!</p>
        <h2 class="ing">Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul class="mother">
            <li class="list">1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
            <li class="list">¼ cup water</li>
            <li class="list">1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li class="list">12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, or more if needed</li>
            <li class="list">1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li class="list">3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
            <li class="list">1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>
            <li class="list">1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        </ul> 
        <h2 class="dire">Directions</h2>
        <ol class="father">
            <li class="ste">Step 1</li>
            <p class="list">Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</p>
            <li class="ste">Step 2</li>
            <p class="list">Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat 
                and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until 
                beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer 
                pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any 
                excess grease. Add water and taco seasoning; 
                cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 
                5 to 10 minutes.

            </p>
            <li class="ste">Step 3</li>
            <p class="list">Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the 
                casserole dish; spread about half the can 
                of refried beans and half the ground beef atop 
                the tortilla layer. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack 
                cheese over ground beef layer. Arrange 3 more 
                tortillas over the cheese. Spread in the remaining 
                1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce; 
                sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese. Arrange 3 more 
                tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup 
                Colby-Jack cheese. Top with last 3 tortillas and 
                remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.</p>
            <li class="ste">Step 4</li>  
            <p class="list">Bake in the preheated oven until 
                top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 
                minutes. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.

            </p>  
            <li class="ste">Step 5</li>
            <p class="list">Turn on oven's broiler.</p>
            <li class="ste">Step 6</li>
            <p class="list">Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack 
                cheese is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
